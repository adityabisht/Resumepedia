This project led to an ICDE 2012 paper (12/2011-06 /2012)Research AssistantBeijing University of Posts and Telecommunications - 北京市 - September 2007 to June 2009Selected Research Project:• DBPARAFC introduces disk and buffer sensitive scheduling and buffer replacement mechanisms for efficient implementations of in-database analytic system for in-database tensor decompositions. This paper submitted to EDBT2015 (06/2014-10/2014)• Personalized Tensor Decomposition proposes novel Personalized Tensor Decomposition (PTD) mechanism based onPARAFAC for large-scale problem, which boosts the accuracy of user's focus tensor block and also improves runtimeefficiency. This project led to an CIKM 2014 paper(11/2013-05/2014)• Robust Personalized PageRank shows that novel teleportation discounting and seed-set maximal PPR techniques helpeliminate harmful bias of individual seed nodes, which improve the recommendation performance significantly. Thisproject led to an ASONAM 2014 paper (06/2013-10 /2014)• Bulk Synchronous Parallel develops iterative social network analysis system build for high scalability on ApacheHama, which is a distributed computing framework based on BSP Model which is extension of Hadoop and moreEDUCATIONPh.D. in Computer ScienceArizona State University - Tempe, AZ September 2011 to PresentM.S. in Pattern RecognitionBeijing University of Posts and Telecommunications - 北京市 September 2008 to July 2011￼B.E. in Technology & Instrument of Observation & ControlChina University of Geosciences Beijing - 北京市 September 2004 to June 2008LINKS http://www.linkedin.com/pub/xinsheng-li/32/87a/765ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONSkills• Big Data platform: sciDB, Apache hadoop, Apache hama, Apache Giraph • Programming Language: C/C++, Java, Matlab, Python￼
