Developed networking interface to achieve Dynamic Source Routing based route search & message delivery for Open Source Wireless Development platform Motesquito. This routing ability is further desired to be used for wireless localization.• Undergraduate Project: Developed a prototype low cost 3D Scanner which won 2nd prize in an IEEE symposium. The scanner detected contours from sequential scanned images of 3D object & rendered them￼to obtain a 3D model. The images were obtained through an image acquisition Simulink model & processed using MATLAB.Coursework ProjectsEmbedded C• Developed an Arduino based XBee configurable line following robot using driver IC L293D.[Advanced Embedded Systems, Spring 2014]• Implemented CAN bus protocol for transmission of data using two Renesas RX63N development boards.
