Matt James Linux ProfessionalLongmont, CO - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Matt-James/5f9e0f96bc61ce44I've been in IT in varying roles for the last 15+ years. I started out as a Windows / Novell Netware systems administrator and have evolved across the Mac platform into a Linux systems administrator. I've touched many different areas of IT but excel at configuration management, systems integration, operational support, and troubleshooting. I pride myself in being able to see issues from a 30,000 ft view and then focus on what needs to be dealt with. I like to see an issue though to completion and am not satisfied with a "good enough" solution. I'm looking for opportunities to work with like-minded people who are on a mission to make a difference in our community, both locally and globally.WORK EXPERIENCEComputer ConsultantSelf employed - Longmont, CO - 1999 to PresentProvide IT support solutions to small and medium sized companies.Concentrations include network hardware, systems deployment and maintenance, remote access, VPN, wireless networking, and security.Install and maintain telephone, audio/video, home automation, and security systems.Linux Virtualization EngineerDigitalGlobe - Longmont, CO - December 2014 to February 2015(Contractor via TekSystems)Day to day operations support for secure and accredited US government systems.Automated systems management through use of Puppet, Subversion / Git, and RedHat Satellite User management utilizing Oracle LDAP, Centrify, and RedHat IDM / FreeIPA.Virtual machine and cluster management via vmware vCenter / vCops.Development of new RHEL 7 baseline server images and updated tool chain (Puppet 3, Infoblox) Supported continuous deployment systems using JenkinsTicketing handled via RT (RequestTracker) and CA Service Desk ManagerIT Manager & Systems EngineerDeTect, Inc - Longmont, CO - June 2008 to December 2014Build out of RedHat / CentOS Linux and Windows systems for use in weather radar operations.
