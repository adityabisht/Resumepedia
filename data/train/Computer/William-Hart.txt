I possess many leadership qualities and I am an excellent communicator when it comes to resolving conflicts. I am very calm when under pressure and always try to find the positive aspects of a negative situation. I am quick at multi-tasking, especially when I'm familiar with the tools I'm multitasking with. Most importantly, I love to learn and often take interest in challenging myselfwhen it comes to new experiences or opportunities.WORK EXPERIENCENetwork AdministratorLegislative Research Commission - Frankfort, KY - April 2008 to PresentSCCM 2007 and 2012• Active Directory• Virus/Malware/Spyware Removal• SCOM 2012• Hardware Specialist• Basic Networking• Training and/or Supervising of New Employees• HelpDesk.exe (Our In-House Ticketing Program)• Windows Server 2003-2012• VMware• Hyper-V• IIS7• Experienced in Microsoft Office Suite 2003-2013• Experience with Mac OS and Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Pear, Zorin, and Comice etc.)Inside Software Sales Account ManagerPlanet Solutions - Lexington, KY - August 2007 to April 2008Troubleshooting and Management of 1,200 Accounts • Software Sales• Performed Live Demonstrations our Products• Cold Calling• Database Management (Goldmine)Franklin County Circuit Deputy ClerkDriver's Licensing - Frankfort, KY - August 2004 to August 2007KY 40601Driver's Licensing• Issuance of Permits, Licenses and Ids• Public Servant• Assisted Those Individuals Who Needed Help With Re-instatement • Proof of Satisfied Citations￼Customer ServiceSears Fayette Mall - Lexington, KY - May 2003 to December 2005Commission Sales• High Familiarity With All Electronic MerchandiseSales AssociatePier One Imports - Lexington, KY - July 2002 to May 2003Customer Service• Assembly of Merchandise • Furniture SalesSales AssociateExpress Men - Lexington, KY - May 2002 to July 2002Customer Service • Ring Up Sales• Folding ClothesSales AssociateElder Beer-man - Frankfort, KY - September 2000 to January 2002Customer Service and Ring Up Sales• 100 Percent Score From Secret Shopper's Experiences • Folding ClothesCourtesy ClerkKroger West - Frankfort, KY - April 2000 to August 2000Customer Service• Stock Merchandise• Other General Labor as NeededEDUCATIONComputer Information Systems ManagementMidway College - Midway, KY 2009 to 2013high school diplomaWestern Hills High School - Frankfort, KY 1998 to 2002
