During bankruptcy proceedings the majority of their assets were sold to different companies. Included in the sale were many file servers and their email infrastructure. My responsibility was to lead the project of migrating the sold servers off of JRCC's domain and also migrating JRCC to a new email system. I chose migrate JRCC from an on premise email infrastructure to a hosted cloud solution and decided to use Exchange online hosted by Microsoft.In 2009 & 2010 I managed two major projects for James River Coal Co. In the summer of 2009, I managed and was instrumental of the negotiation of pricing of a project where we migrated from a frame relay network to a point to point private line network. At the time we had 12 different locations that needed connectivity. This project took several months and much discussion with our provider at the time to ensure we maintained a stable work environment. The next project was the winter / spring of 2009/2010 when we migrated from a single MS Exchange 2003 server to a three server MS Exchange 2010 cluster environment. This move was to increase our capacity of our email database as well provide fault tolerance in case of a failure.WRIC-TV8In the spring of 2004 there was migration of our network from a peer to peer network to client server based network and I was very instrumental in setting up and configuring the new Windows 2003 servers. During this project the clients were converted from a terminal based environment to a PC based environment. I was the primary individual that scheduled and performed the rollouts of new machines to the user community. Also the clients were converted from a POP3 mail system to a SMTP based system utilizing Microsoft Exchange 2003.
