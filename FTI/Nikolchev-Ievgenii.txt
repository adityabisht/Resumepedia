I use Clojure for hobby projects. I like learn new things in CS,ï¿¼currently I study Machine Learning.I think that production code should be as simple aspossible and covered with tests, to achieve this I use TDD.I prefer unix as working environment, IntelliJ IDEA as JavaIDE, VIM as text editor, GIT as VCS.I consider myself as a server side developer. At my currentjob I focused on creating and supporting distributed javabased REST services. We use MYSQL as persistable storage and Couchbase as a cache. Also We use Spring DI, Spring MVC for REST API's, Spring boot for micro-services. We useLinux as production and testing environment.None technical summaryForeign languages: English - upper-intermediate
