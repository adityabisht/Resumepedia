Mindi Grissom Brand ManagerSeattle, WA - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Mindi-Grissom/ca09594daad1cd00I remember helping my mom put up advertisements in retail grocery stores featuring Tony the Tiger, Mr. Clean and the Pillsbury Doughboy at the ripe old age of 6. Although I wasn't paid and it was probably against child labor laws, my passion for marketing emerged during those early years of grassroots marketing activities.After finishing my B.S. in business in two years while working full time, I decided to use my love of marketing to sell brands like Frosted Flakes at the headquarter level. To further my career, I pursued my MBA in marketing at Foster School of Business where my business and market development skills were sharpened.My executed strategies have:• Increased market share by 3 points• Expanded client base by 30%• Created innovative technical solutions to increase sales over 7%My top projects include:• Evaluating market segment opportunities for new product introduction in healthcare • Executing digital marketing strategy for food entrepreneurial startup• Analyzing data to create category and brand sales strategies in CPGKnowing the value of hard work, since my early days of toiling away with legacy CPG brands, I want to utilize my expertise in brand and product management for good not evil.
