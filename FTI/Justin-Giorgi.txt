Justin Giorgi Software Developer - Jeld-WenKlamath Falls, OR - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Justin-Giorgi/14de63be37b78f24I'm a simple developer specializing in testing and automation. I believe that automation and thorough test cases improve the maintainability of software. Developers should be spending time delivering value to the user and the business not fixing an endless stream of mysterious bugs. I make that happen with a combination of unit tests, functional test cases and automated code deployment.WORK EXPERIENCESoftware DeveloperJeld-Wen - August 2013 to PresentAutomating testing, deployment and data migration for critical sales technology.
