The data is collected from KEGG, NCBI, MirBase, TargetScan and MicroCosm databases.– Provide support for front-end GUI development of desktop (Java Swing, JavaFX, CSS) and web-based applications (AngularJS and HTML).– Involved in client-server communication (RESTful webservice) and server- side software development (SpringMVC, Hibernate,).– Involved in regular updates of database (Postgres, SQL).ResearcherDublin City University - Dublin, CA - September 2008 to November 2012Developed an ontology editor (using NetBeans IDE) that can be used to create, load and update the ontologies (written in OWL language). The editor is based on OWL API (i.e., defacto W3C standard for OWL ontologies). The ontology editor is built in Java and the front-end user interface is written using Java Swing.- Integrated the ontology editor with Sesame (an open source Java framework for storage and querying of RDF data).- Transformed complex algorithms into Java-based ETL implementation for the extraction of the patterns of ontology change. SPARQL queries were used to extract the ontology changes from the change log and were converted into GraphML format files. Graph-based pattern mining approach was used in this context.Java InstructorDublin City University - Dublin - January 2010 to October 2010Worked as a Java Instructor at the training courses, suitable for ITProfessionals & Programmers.
