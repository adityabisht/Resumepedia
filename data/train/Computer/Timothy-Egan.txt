It is ourresponsibility to add new programs and services to this framework, as well as ensure the existing system is runningsmoothly.Skills UsedAll source elements are written in COBOL, so when I took this job I had to learn this new programming language. I demonstrated a quick learning ability when confronted with this task, as well as a motivation to be a valuable part of the team. I used excellent communication skills to determine what the clients needs were, and then worked with my team to design, develop and test these new programs. A deadline every few months meant that I had to organize my tasks, plan ahead, multi-task and work under pressure to achieve the desired results.EDUCATIONBS in Computer ScienceSiena College - Albany, NY 2006 to 2010SKILLSHTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Wordpress, PHP, MySQL, COBOL, PhotoshopLINKS http://twegan.com￼￼
