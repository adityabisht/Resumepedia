I'm open to any specific questions about this project as well.OLDER PROJECTSFACEBOOK APPLICATION: http://ian-butler.com/SocialMediaProject/index.htmlThis application has a complex user interface meant to mimic Facebook. The opening page has two buttons, one that opens up a description using a JQuery click event. The other button opens up a registration page. When you fill out the registration page, that info runs through a validation function to make sure it was entered in the right format. It is then stored in a parse.com database. That information is then populated on a profile page that you are then taken to. You can also skip entering the info by going strait to ian-butler.com/ SocialMediaProject/profilePage.html.From the profile page your friends are also populated using AJAX from another database on parse.com. In the search bar above you can search through your friends using a Javascript filtering function. The friends page and the about me page are also active. Not every link on this site is active. Most of them are for show. The style of the page was created using CSS and Sass to keep the CSS looking cleaner and more manageable.ï¿¼The site is somewhat responsive in that the advertisement and chat sections will disappear when the browser is resized. This was done using media queries.RESPONSIVE APPLICATION: http://ian-butler.com/Responsive-Design/index.htmlThe Responsive application is a fully responsive and mobile friendly webpage. It was sized using only ems and percentages. If you adjust the size of the screen you will notice that the site will adjust once the content hits certain breaking points. In the footer, once the logo starts to get close to the contact info a media query adjusts the layout so that the contact info goes below the logo. The content section will also in the middle will also sink below the navigation section once the nag section becomes too small. The zoom is also turned off so that this site will also look good on mobile devices.PETE AND CAT'S HORSE BOARDING: http://ian-butler.com/MomsFarm/mine/index.htmlThis site was recently built for a friend of mine with a small horse boarding business. It was built using BootStrap. It is all a single page but uses the tab tool which uses CSS and JQuery to change the tab without having to reload a new webpage. BootStrap is fully responsive so this site is mobile friendly.CHUTES AND LADDERS: http://ian-butler.com/chutesLadders/index.htmlThe chutes and ladders game was created using CSS, JQuery, and JavaScript. Clicking on the dice will simulate the dice roll. This was accomplished using an array of different pictures of the dice. I created a gif image and used a setTimeout function to move to the gif image for a second followed by a random number picked using javascript. The number represented by the dice you got is then added to a counter that takes you to the spot on the board that was made into a grid made by CSS and HTML. A nested setTimeout function then allows for the computer a chance to 'roll the dice' and then move. 'If conditionals' are used for all the ladder and slides. JQuery was used to remove the marker from its former spot to it's new place on the board.EDUCATIONBachelor's of ScienceCalifornia State University 2010
